# Traffic FSM
Traffic light controller project built using AMD Vivado and written in SystemVerilog for the PYNQ-Z1 FPGA. Implements a finite state machine (FSM) to coordinate North-South and East-West traffic lights with timed pedestrian crossing, blinking indicators, and a maintenance override. Includes cycle-based timing, state decoding, and testbench-driven verification.
